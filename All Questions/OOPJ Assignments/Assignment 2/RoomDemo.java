/*
Question 4

Create a class “Room” which will hold the “height”, “width” and “breadth” of the room in three fields. This class 
also has a method “volume()” to calculate the volume of this room. Create another class “RoomDemo” which will 
use the earlier class, create instances of rooms, and display the volume of room.
